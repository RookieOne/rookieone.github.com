    <title>Dynamic + Extension Methods = Fail</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2010/03/17/dynamic-extension-methods-fail/"/>
    <updated>2010-03-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2010/03/17/dynamic-extension-methods-fail</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am playing around with dynamics right now working on a solution for a completely different problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered a issue I didn’t foresee (and maybe I am doing something wrong).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use AssertExtensions to make my tests more readable so I created my first extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static class AssertExtensions
{
    public static void ShouldBe&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(this T actual, T expected)
    {
        Assert.AreEqual(expected, actual);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a test to ‘get’ a property from a dynamic object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[TestMethod]
public void should_be_able_to_get_property()
{
    var book = new Book {Title = &quot;Icarus Hunt&quot;, Author = &quot;Timothy Zahn&quot;};

    var d = book as dynamic;

    d.Author.ShouldBe(&quot;Timothy Zahn&quot;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should work right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/dynamic-fail.png' width='' height='' alt=''Compile fail'' title=''Compile fail''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh noes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the RuntimeBinder can’t figure out the extension to string. My solution was to do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[TestMethod]
public void should_be_able_to_get_property()
{
    var book = new Book {Title = &quot;Icarus Hunt&quot;, Author = &quot;Timothy Zahn&quot;};

    var d = book as dynamic;

    var author = d.Author as string;

    author.ShouldBe(&quot;Timothy Zahn&quot;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just found it interesting that it didn’t behave the way I would have expected.&lt;/p&gt;

    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2010/03/07/adv-wpf-videos</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The videos are up from the Adv WPF Workshop we had here at EPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos (the links are kind of slow and funky atm. I will look into it on Monday. I had more luck downloading the file as opposed to streaming it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;http://www.epsdownloadsite.com/downloads/7a554107-cdd0-4133-967b-913c595971ee/Advanced_WPF_JB_part1.wmv&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;http://www.epsdownloadsite.com/downloads/8adbd281-908b-4301-8135-daddc13361f6/Advanced_WPF_JB_part5.wmv&quot;&gt;Part 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a great time talking through some of the things we are doing here with WPF. I think it took awhile to get started but towards the end I think we picked up speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t exactly recall the topics right now but I believe we did cover these items from the original agenda:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INotifyPropertyChange

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type Safe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic Proxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AOP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View + ViewModel

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typical methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IView extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IView&lt;VM&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ViewRegistry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also will be covering StructureMap conventions (TypeScanners) and Type Interceptors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event Aggregator

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using Events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish extension method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISubscribe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting it all together with a Region Controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I guess one big note would be that PostSharp is no longer open source therefore you need a license for their 2.0 product. At EPS we picked up licenses for our current solution. The benefit we get out of PostSharp and AOP far surpasses the license price even when you have to buy the license for every developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check PostSharp out at (http://www.sharpcrafters.com/)[http://www.sharpcrafters.com/]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we are going to work on a PostSharp CodeCast or some other informative session on the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering we have the Houston Open Spaces coming up, I will probably delay another workshop for a bit. But I had a good time and will probably do another one around May or June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to thank everyone who came online and on site. It was a lot of fun! Please provide feedback so we can make the next workshop even better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Creating my first TFS 2010 Build</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2010/02/23/creating-first-tfs-build/"/>
    <updated>2010-02-23T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2010/02/23/creating-first-tfs-build</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My work this iteration on my project is setting up a CI build and then migrating all our POC code to the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I am creating a simple build as practice for setting up the actual build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am approaching this from a complete n00b when it comes to creating a TFS build. I have created builds before but they have been small and just simple MSBuild files. This is the first time I am using TFS and creating not only a build but a continuous integration environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a Team Project and added a simple C# project to source control. I then looked at the Team Explorer and noticed that there is a Builds section under my project. Intuitively I right clicked and found where I can create a New Build Definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/tfs_thumbnail1.png' width='' height='' alt=''New Build Definition'' title=''New Build Definition''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at the options available to me on the Build Window and noticed a Trigger section. Investigating the Trigger section allowed me to select what triggers this build. Oh look a CI trigger that builds after each check-in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/tfs_thumbnail2.png' width='' height='' alt=''Continuous Integration'' title=''Continuous Integration''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then had to set an output folder so I created a folder on our build machine and set the folder to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/tfs_thumbnail3.png' width='' height='' alt=''Set output folder'' title=''Set output folder''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I was done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have to say we already had a TFS Build Controller setup so I can’t comment on that for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then ran a couple of experiments. I first added a class foo to my project and checked in. I then double clicked on my Build under the TFS explorer and was given two reports. One report showed the current queued builds and the other had a list of the completed builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I ran my first successful build I then made a compile error and checked it in. I then had a failed build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/tfs_thumbnail4.png' width='' height='' alt=''Failed build'' title=''Failed build''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I double clicked the failed build I got this UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/tfs_thumbnail5.png' width='' height='' alt=''Failed build report'' title=''Failed build report''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then created a test project and then made a failing test. Now my build looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/tfs_thumbnail6.png' width='' height='' alt=''Build with failing tests'' title=''Build with failing tests''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I double clicked I got this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/tfs_thumbnail7.png' width='' height='' alt=''Build with failing tests report'' title=''Build with failing tests report''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that was a real quick run through with creating a CI build with TFS 2010. I have to say… I was surprised that it was that easy. I am continuing my work with the build but it looks like the simple scenario was incredibly easy!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ISubscribe</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2010/02/18/isubscribe/"/>
    <updated>2010-02-18T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2010/02/18/isubscribe</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I believe Jimmy Bogard has a similar technique (IHandler&lt;T&gt;) with ASP .Net MVC but I thought I would still share the convention I’ve been using to wire up subscriptions to the Prism Event Aggregator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever an object is built with StructureMap, it goes through all the TypeInterceptors. I have a SubscriptionTypeInterceptor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class SubscriptionInterceptor : TypeInterceptor
{
    public object Process(object target, IContext context)
    {
        var eventAggregator = context.GetInstance&amp;lt;IEventAggregator&amp;gt;();

        // Get interface ISubscribe&amp;lt;E&amp;gt;
        var interfaces = target.GetType().GetInterfaces().Where(i =&amp;gt; i.Name.Contains(&quot;ISubscribe&quot;));

        foreach (var type in interfaces)
        {
            // typeof(E)
            var eventType = type.GetGenericArguments()[0];

            var setupMethod = GetType().GetMethod(&quot;Setup&quot;);
            setupMethod.MakeGenericMethod(eventType).Invoke(this, new[] { target, eventAggregator });
        }

        return target;
    }

    public bool MatchesType(Type type)
    {
        return type.ImplementsInterfaceTemplate(typeof(ISubscribe&amp;lt;&amp;gt;));
    }

    public void Setup&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(ISubscribe&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; subscriber, IEventAggregator eventAggregator)
    {
        eventAggregator
            .GetEvent&amp;lt;CompositePresentationEvent&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;()
            .Subscribe(subscriber.Subscribe);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it finds all the ISubscribe&lt;T&gt; interfaces the target implements and then subscribes the target to the event T in the event aggregator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface ISubscribe&amp;lt;E&amp;gt;
{
    void Subscribe(E e);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple example of usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class SecurityController : IController,
                                  ISubscribe&amp;lt;RequestUserLoginEvent&amp;gt;
{
    public void Subscribe(RequestUserLoginEvent e)
    {
        Publish.Event().ShowModal&amp;lt;IRequestUserLoginViewModel&amp;gt;();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recorded a podcast with Markus and Ken on Tuesday and it was published last night. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked about Convention over Configuration using tools like Structure Map, PostSharp, Prism, etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the podcast using itunes or online at:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>View + ViewModel + ViewRegistry</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2010/02/17/view-viewmodel-viewregistry/"/>
    <updated>2010-02-17T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2010/02/17/view-viewmodel-viewregistry</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the Advanced WPF Workshop on Saturday Feb 20th, I thought I would throw together some blog posts around some techniques / code I will be sharing. JP asked the other day whether Views should have references to their ViewModels or should ViewModels have references to Views. Unfortunately twitter is a great medium for asking this question but not the best medium for answering the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to try using the dry marker board as a form of communication with my blogs. I have little patience for lining up pretty lines and colored boxes with Visio or Power Point. A dry marker board is fast and allows for a free flowing expression of my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me try to diagram out how I currently manage my Views and ViewModels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/view_viewmodel_viewregistry_whiteboard.jpg' width='' height='' alt=''View ViewModel ViewRegistry Whiteboard'' title=''View ViewModel ViewRegistry Whiteboard''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ask the StructureMap container for the ViewModel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The VM instance is intercepted by a ViewModelTypeInterceptor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside the VMTypeInterceptor

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the V for out VM from the container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the ViewRegistry from the container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register the V with the VM in the ViewRegistry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return the VM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally our VM is returned being registered with a V in the ViewRegistry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In short my ViewModel has no reference to my View, my View has no reference to my ViewModel (beyond setting the DataContext), and my View Registry registers the mappings between View and ViewModel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best code to look for this is in the ViewModelInterceptor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class ViewModelInterceptor : TypeInterceptor
{
    public object Process(object target, IContext context)
    {
        var name = target.GetType().Name;

        var view = context.GetInstance&amp;lt;IView&amp;gt;(name);

        context.GetInstance&amp;lt;IViewRegistry&amp;gt;()
            .RegisterViewWith(target as IViewModel, view);

        return target;
    }

    public bool MatchesType(Type type)
    {
        return type.CanBeCastTo(typeof (IViewModel));
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On February 20th from 9 am (central) until we get bored… I guess 1pm, we will be having a free Advanced WPF Workshop here at EPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me emphasize ….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FREE!!!!!!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When : Feb 20th 9am - 1pm+&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where : EPS Office&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6605 Cypresswood Dr, Suite 300
Spring, TX 77379&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;350&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=6605+cypresswood+dr+sprint+tx&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=64.792576,135.263672&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=6605+Cypresswood+Dr,+Spring,+Harris,+Texas+77379&amp;amp;z=17&amp;amp;ll=30.014289,-95.507411&amp;amp;output=embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently the agenda looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INotifyPropertyChange

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type Safe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic Proxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AOP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View &amp;amp; ViewModel

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typical methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IView extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IView&lt;VM&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ViewRegistry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also will be covering StructureMap conventions (TypeScanners) and Type Interceptors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event Aggregator

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using Events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish extension method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISubscribe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting it all together with a Region Controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commands

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ICommand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action / Delegate Command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decorating with a Named Command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;might be using commands with a convention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource Locator

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource Dictionary Convention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image Convention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And anything else that comes up during our discussions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential additions:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul Stovell’s MicroModel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dependency Property Inheritance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attached Dep Property Behaviors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blend Behaviors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual State Manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We will be recording the session so have no fear if you can’t come or join us online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very excited about the workshop! Its a great opportunity to share some stuff I’ve been doing with WPF. User groups and brown bags offer only limited exposure to these techniques. With this workshop we get to dive into code and get rapid interactions. I hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Goal</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/12/17/the-goal/"/>
    <updated>2009-12-17T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/12/17/the-goal</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With my current mindset that things are broken, I dive into my current readings including The Goal and The Toyota Way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271781%3FSubscriptionId%3D0JTCV5ZMHMF7ZYTXGFR2%26tag%3Dbrdicr-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0884271781&quot;&gt;The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/the-goal.jpg' width='' height='' alt='' title=''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read The Goal back in my business graduate school days (about 5 years ago), but now its reading has a whole new impact. I am seeing more into the book after 5 years of working in software than I did as a fresh college graduate. Some of the mental exercises the protagonist in the book is going through I am going through as well. As he wrestles answering questions concerning his factory, I am wrestling with the questions concerning my software projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first exercise is to define 'the goal' for his company and all companies. Of course the protagonist takes a long time to come to the logical conclusion that it's to make money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every company's goal is to make money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software consulting company, how do we make money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We make money by winning a bid for a project and then performing the work to complete the project within budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That seems pretty simple. Nothing about data access technologies, TDD, user stories, or any sort of architecture or design pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need X done and will pay $Y then we should do X for less than $Y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it so hard to deliver on that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimate Y&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If we scope a project then we need to know what X is. Simple to say, but man is it difficult to capture!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X is always in motion, a moving target. The client changes their mind, we have scope creep, and what appears simple always ends up being more complex. We all know this! Its the one constant with software development. Things are going to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my perspective, SOLID and design patterns focus on writing code that is more adaptive to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOLID and design patterns in of themselves do NOT move us towards our goal by reducing the cost of writing software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOLID and design patterns move us towards our goal when our software has to change because the cost of the change has been reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principles and patterns also provide a common language for developers. That common language moves us closer to the goal because current and new developers can grok more of the design in less time. And time = money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does testing fit into all this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing allows us to keep track of the quality of our production. Or.. does it? After some re-examination I want to say testing adds no quality. That will have to be another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing provides a way to measure our progress towards X. We know we are moving towards X because we can have tests that verify we are delivering towards our promise. When I mention testing I am using a broad definition and including all sorts of tests from UAT testers to automated unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does Test Driven Development (TDD) provide? TDD focuses every bit of code towards satisfying a test. If every test is relevant towards progress towards X, then TDD focuses our development towards productive work. Logically any work not moving us towards delivering X to our clients is unproductive work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What conclusions have I come to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of a software consulting company is to make money. We make money by completing X under $Y. One of the important steps is to then define what X is. We know X will change so we should write code that is adaptive to change, but we need to balance that with only writing code that moves us towards delivering X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We achieve more flexible and understandable code by using SOLID and design patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We measure our progress towards X by passing tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDD focuses our coding towards productive work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I started to write about estimation in this section but have decided to move it to another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After thinking about estimation, it has nothing to do with knowing what X is. Estimation has to do with what we think $Y is. X is what X is regardless if it takes you 3 hours or 3 months to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jaded .Net</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/12/16/jaded-net/"/>
    <updated>2009-12-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/12/16/jaded-net</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love talking with Ryan and others passionate about new technology and languages. Lately though I have been increasingly jaded with anything ‘new’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many different data technologies do we need? ADO .Net, Nhibernate, Linq-2-SQL, Entity Framework version.. whatever. We have been connecting to databases for over 20 years so why are we still worrying about this?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of UI frameworks is reaching the point of ridiculousness. I was reading the WPF Disciples Google Group and ran across this post. Paul Stovell listed all the MVVM, MVC, MVC frameworks he knew of (around 11). Then everyone was commenting with their own ‘me too’ response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one who finds that utterly hilarious? How many frameworks do we need?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan is extremely involved with Ruby, Python, F#, and the other ‘new’ languages to the .Net Framework. I have been delaying learning Ruby for too long, because it's hard to get motivated to learn a new language. I see the potential and the possibilities, but I quickly get discouraged and uninterested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to ask myself… why am I jaded? Why am I disinterested in things that used to excite me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I thought about it, the more the conclusion became crystal clear. Every project I have been a part of has had the same problems. None of the problems were technology related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would I get excited about a solution to a problem I don’t have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of Karl Pilkington’s comment about this picture of twins on one of the Ricky Gervais podcasts. Karl saw a picture of a set of twins on an office desk (obviously the kids of the guy sitting at the desk). His great idea was since they look alike and are dressed alike, the parent could just have the picture of one of them and save space. Ricky Gervais then commented something like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you have there is the best non-solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is pretty much how I feel about most of the technological innovations these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: can someone explain to me how Oslo is going to help me? I am also not sold on RIA or anything Cloud related. The technology is interesting, but I can’t justify where I would use any of this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='left ' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/shoveling-coal.jpg' width='240' height='165' alt=''Shoveling Coal'' title=''Shoveling Coal''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like a lone engineer shoveling coal into a furnace on a runaway train. I don't know where we are going, where we have been, and all I hear is FASTER, FASTER!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I scream for help, I get delivered a better shovel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't want a better shovel, I want to know why I am shoveling so much coal!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can't we do more with less? Can’t we slow down? Do we even know why we are in this train?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately the murmurings on different blogs, podcasts, and developers has been that software development has gotten too complicated. How can that be true when we have tons of tools and frameworks that should make life easier? jQuery makes Javascript easier. Pick your favorite Data Access tool / ORM makes data access easier. Any number of UI frameworks makes UI construction easier. So why do we think things are more complicated? Shouldn’t our life be easier?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of projects are always behind, always over budgeted, and always unclear on where they are and where they are going. This has been my experience spanning multiple companies and multiple positions on different teams. I am fully humble enough to recognize that “I” might be the problem, but I doubt it. There is enough shared pain through my conversations with other developers to recognize its a industry wide problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only project I was a part of that didn’t feel this way had a full time Project Manager and a team full of very skilled developers. To me it didn’t feel like the project was better run, it was just we had enough skilled team members to overcome any poor execution or poor planning. That isn’t saying our PM wasn’t an all star because he was. My point is that although the project was a ‘success’ I didn’t feel like it was successful because we had a great methodology. We just powered through any complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every project (including that last ‘successful’ one) always had mad dashes of insane hours of work followed by listless lulls as we waited for one thing or another. I never felt I had enough time to do my work and other activities related to work (ie blog, present, create frameworks)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where am I going with this? I wanted to capture my state of mind and why I am re-examining how and why I develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status quo will burn me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ole definition of insanity : Doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am tired of doing the same thing, so what can I do different? Why is there this constant pain? I know there are solutions and it's time for me to document my mental journey as I search for answers. Maybe my breadcrumbs will help those that follow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Examining how we develop software</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/12/15/examining-how-we-develop-software/"/>
    <updated>2009-12-15T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/12/15/examining-how-we-develop-software</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What I am starting is a mental exercise exploring how my view on software development is changing. Since this is a basically a brain dump, treat it as such. Feel free to comment on what I say... offer advice and opinions. Maybe there is something you can sympathize with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has started me thinking along these lines has been my recent readings of The Toyota Way and my re-reading of The Goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Toyota Way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/toyota-way.jpg' width='108' height='160' alt=''The Toyota Way'' title=''The Toyota Way''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/the-goal.jpg' width='108' height='160' alt=''The Goal'' title=''The Goal''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both readings have me re-examining my career and software development. Asking questions like, Are we focused on the right things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway here are the posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jaded .Net&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Goal&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Named Command Decorator</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/11/25/named-command-decorator/"/>
    <updated>2009-11-25T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/11/25/named-command-decorator</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is the problem, we have a list of ‘commands’ we wish to show depending on what view model / entity is active. If we just had a collection of ICommands, we could show buttons but what would their content be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution is to use the decorator pattern to decorate commands with a Name that can be used as the content for the buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My decorator looks like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class NamedCommand : ICommand
{
    public NamedCommand(ICommand decoratedCommand, string name)
    {
        _DecoratedCommand = decoratedCommand;
        Name = name;
    }

    readonly ICommand _DecoratedCommand;
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public void Execute(object parameter)
    {
        _DecoratedCommand.Execute(parameter);
    }

    public bool CanExecute(object parameter)
    {
        return _DecoratedCommand.CanExecute(parameter);
    }

    public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged;
} 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then created an extension method on ICommand :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static ICommand Name(this ICommand command, string name)
{
    return new NamedCommand(command, name);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the code I can now do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Commands.Add(new ActionCommand(OnOpen).Name(&quot;Open&quot;));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my WPF visual, I have a DataTemplate :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` xml&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;DataTemplate DataType=&quot;{x:Type Commands:NamedCommand}&quot; &amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Button Content=&quot;{Binding Name}&quot;
           Command=&quot;{Binding }&quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/DataTemplate&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Aop INotifyPropertyChanged StructureMap</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/10/29/aop-structure-map/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/10/29/aop-structure-map</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has worked with INotifyPropertyChanged knows that this simple interface can be a royal pain in the ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try and eliminate the pain, people have created some great solutions using AOP : IL weaving (&lt;a href=&quot;www.postsharp.org&quot;&gt;PostSharp&lt;/a&gt;) and using a proxy (&lt;a href=&quot;http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/05/implementing-inotifypropertychanged.html&quot;&gt;Castle Dynamic Proxy&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PostSharp has a little too much voodoo for me atm. I think I will warm up to it though and re-examine using PostSharp on my next solution. But for now, I wanted to use Castle Project’s Dynamic Proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally since Castle also has a very popular IoC container in Windsor, most examples marry Dynamic Proxy and Windsor to form an AOP INotifyPropertyChanged solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I am using StructureMap for this project, I endeavored to create my own solution using Dynamic Proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first attempt I shared at the Virtual Brown Bag look liked it worked but in reality I was constructing my objects twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once with SM and once with the Proxy generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to go back to the drawing board and posted my problem at the SM google group. &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/structuremap-users/browse_thread/thread/1a6b19ce8152db1b?hl=en&quot;&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/structuremap-users/browse_thread/thread/1a6b19ce8152db1b?hl=en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the syntax given to me was an older version of SM. For the record, I am using version 2.5.3.0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it did direct me to the general idea on where I should start looking. I ended up needing to create an IBuildInterceptor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyBuildInterceptor : IBuildInterceptor
   {
       public MyBuildInterceptor(Type concreteType)
       {
           _ConcreteType = concreteType;
       }

       readonly Type _ConcreteType;

       public object Build(BuildSession buildSession, Type pluginType, Instance instance)
       {
           var constructorArgs = _ConcreteType
               .GetConstructors()
               .FirstOrDefault()
               .GetParameters()
               .Select(p =&amp;gt; buildSession.CreateInstance(p.ParameterType))
               .ToArray();


           var interceptors = new List&amp;lt;IInterceptor&amp;gt;
                                  {
                                      new NotifyInterceptor()
                                  }
                                  .ToArray();

           return new ProxyGenerator().CreateClassProxy(_ConcreteType, interceptors, constructorArgs);
       }

       public IBuildPolicy Clone()
       {
           return InnerPolicy.Clone();
       }

       public void EjectAll()
       {
           InnerPolicy.EjectAll();
       }

       public IBuildPolicy InnerPolicy { get; set; }
   }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To register my ViewModels I created a convention using a TypeScanner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyNotifyConvention : ITypeScanner
{
    public void Process(Type type, PluginGraph graph)
    {

        if (type.GetInterface(&quot;IViewModel&quot;) == null)
            return;

        var interfaceType = type.GetInterfaces().FirstOrDefault(i =&amp;gt; i.Name.Contains(&quot;ViewModel&quot;)
                                                            &amp;amp;&amp;amp; i.Name != &quot;IViewModel&quot;);

        if (interfaceType == null)
            return;

        graph.Configure(r =&amp;gt;
                        r.ForRequestedType(interfaceType)
                        .InterceptConstructionWith(new MyBuildInterceptor(type))
                        .TheDefaultIsConcreteType(type));
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then used a Dynamic Proxy Interceptor that I basically copy and pasted from Serial Seb’s example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class NotifyInterceptor : IInterceptor
{
    public void Intercept(IInvocation invocation)
    {
        // let the original call go through first, so we can notify *after*
        invocation.Proceed();

        if (invocation.Method.Name.StartsWith(&quot;set_&quot;))
        {
            string propertyName = invocation.Method.Name.Substring(4);
            RaisePropertyChangedEvent(invocation, propertyName, invocation.TargetType);
        }
    }

    void RaisePropertyChangedEvent(IInvocation invocation, string propertyName, Type type)
    {
        // get the field storing the delegate list that are stored by the event.
        var methodInfo = type.GetMethod(&quot;RaisePropertyChanged&quot;);

        if (methodInfo == null)
        {
            if (type.BaseType != null)
                RaisePropertyChangedEvent(invocation, propertyName, type.BaseType);
        }
        else // info != null
        {
            methodInfo.Invoke(invocation.InvocationTarget, new object[] {propertyName});
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking for the PropertyChanged Handler, I create a RaisePropertyChanged method and use that. Although I could raise the event using the field method Seb was using, WPF wasn’t updating the binding. I didn’t really bother to investigate and just rolled with this solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s my solution and I’ll start using it in my current solution. Naturally I will clean up the code some more etc. Feel free to use this for any of your own projects. You can also get the solution at my GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>London Time?</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/10/27/london-time/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/10/27/london-time</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friend ping’d me on gchat and asked if he had a DateTime object with our time in Texas, how could he get the time in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly threw together this example on how I would do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DateTime time = DateTime.Now;

TimeZoneInfo londonTimeZone = TimeZoneInfo
    .GetSystemTimeZones()
    .FirstOrDefault(t =&amp;gt; t.DisplayName.Contains(&quot;London&quot;));

DateTime londonTime = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTime(time, londonTimeZone);

Console.WriteLine(&quot;Its {0} here&quot;, time);
Console.WriteLine(&quot;But its {0} in London&quot;, londonTime);
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Blimey!&quot;);
Console.ReadLine();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virtual Brown Bag 10/22/09</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/10/22/vbb-summary/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/10/22/vbb-summary</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was a great virtual brown bag. Claudio will have a more exhaustive list of what was discussed, but I thought I would share some links to stuff I talked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Creating a Generic Type using Reflection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://geekswithblogs.net/marcel/archive/2007/03/24/109722.aspx&quot;&gt;http://geekswithblogs.net/marcel/archive/2007/03/24/109722.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static object CreateGeneric(Type generic, Type innerType, params object[] args)
{
    System.Type specificType = generic.MakeGenericType(new System.Type[] { innerType });
    return Activator.CreateInstance(specificType, args);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;StackOverflow Question from Marvin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1532991/help-with-a-windows-service-scheduled-task-that-must-use-a-web-browser-and-file-d&quot;&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1532991/help-with-a-windows-service-scheduled-task-that-must-use-a-web-browser-and-file-d &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Marvin and Claudio talked, I threw together an example on how I would solve the problem. Hopefully we can hear back from Marvin on whether it worked. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code snippet is here : &lt;a href=&quot;http://codesnippets.joyent.com/posts/show/2345&quot;&gt;http://codesnippets.joyent.com/posts/show/2345&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` csharp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var url = &quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/files/exported-font-and-colors-for-jeff-atwood-sept-19.zip&quot;;

var request = WebRequest.Create(url) as HttpWebRequest;

var response = request.GetResponse();

var readStream = response.GetResponseStream();

var fileStream = new FileStream(@&quot;C:\temp\dlZip.zip&quot;, FileMode.Create);

int readByte = readStream.ReadByte();
while(readByte != -1)
{
    fileStream.WriteByte((byte)readByte);
    readByte = readStream.ReadByte();
}

fileStream.Flush();
fileStream.Close();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Using StructureMap with Castle Dynamic Proxy for INotifyPropertyChanged AOP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For creating the DynamicProxy interceptor I based my code off of : &lt;a href=&quot;http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/05/implementing-inotifypropertychanged.html&quot;&gt;http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/05/implementing-inotifypropertychanged.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire solution can be found here : &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/RookieOne/StructureMapAopNotify&quot;&gt;http://github.com/RookieOne/StructureMapAopNotify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a darn good Virtual Brown Bag. :)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My New Career at Code / EPS</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/10/19/new-career-at-eps/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/10/19/new-career-at-eps</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been over a week since I started at Code / EPS and I have to say I am loving it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='right ' src='http://www.iamrookieone.com/images/career-at-eps.jpg' width='224' height='184' alt=''Computer at EPS'' title=''Computer at EPS''&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My computer came in on Friday and I spent most of the day setting it up. Everyone knows the drill of installing Visual Studio, Office, third party tools, etc. It’s a ritual of blessing a new computer for programming work. The picture on the right was taken with my iPhone. The two 24 inch monitors are freakin awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of intangibles that make working at EPS fun and a perfect fit for me at this time. Sharing an office with Claudio is a huge perk.  Having Markus as a boss is also a pleasant change. Most bosses can be disconnected from the current pulse on software development. Markus stays up to date and is also passionate about being cutting edge. Its nice working with people you respect and can learn from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like that I am not working at the client. Having worked at the clients offices for several years, I began to dislike the random commutes, unknown work conditions, and random hardware configurations. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I have an office, with a window. I have a nice computer setup so that I can maximize my productivity. I know where I will be 2-3 months out. All in all, a nice change that adds peace of mind. I can now focus on my next phase in my career.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Catapult -> EPS</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/09/29/catapult-to-eps/"/>
    <updated>2009-09-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/09/29/catapult-to-eps</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you have not heard already, I am leaving Catapult Systems to go join the team at EPS Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catapult Systems is a fantastic company. They are a NSI (National Systems Integrator) and have 12 Microsoft competencies. They were awarded the 2009 Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference Award for Custom Development Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catapultsystems.com/About/News/Articles/Pages/CatapultSystemsWinsEliteMicrosoftWorldwidePartneroftheYearAward.aspx&quot;&gt;http://www.catapultsystems.com/About/News/Articles/Pages/CatapultSystemsWinsEliteMicrosoftWorldwidePartneroftheYearAward.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will have to put a little plug in here and say I was part of the team at Wisenbaker. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My departure has nothing to do with an exodus from Catapult. Catapult has positioned itself as a Microsoft Consulting company. I focus on Custom Application Development. What that means is I have very little interest in Sharepoint, EPM, Infrastructure, etc. I view selling and producing custom software products as a very different task than rolling out Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also really want to focus more on training, presenting, and overall community activity. While Catapult encouraged this behavior (particularly Mark Whitmire), it was all done outside my normal duties. With EPS and some changes Markus has in store, we hope to make that part of my duties and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My move is about my goals being slightly different than Catapult’s goals while EPS’s goals are more aligned with what I want to achieve. For example, at Houston TechFest I had some EPS coworkers come up and offer their support and advice. It was greatly appreciated. Their attendance and conversations made it clear they are pleased to have me on the team and are there to make me better at what I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have lots of good friends at Catapult : Ryan Riley, David Morton, John McPherson, Apollo Gonzalez, Rafael Perez, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have great ideas on revolutionizing the Application Development practice and I wish them the best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I am really looking forward to working with the team at EPS. I’ve gotten to know Markus and Claudio (and others at EPS) over the past couple of months and am really impressed with them. This is my first time to be going to a company where I already know people (and respect their professionalism and skill level).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will still be doing Virtual Brown Bags with Claudio and will now be in a situation where it should be easier for me to participate. Before I had to arrange rooms with the client and never knew if I could have privacy, etc. It was a pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last day at Catapult will be Sept 30th. I then go on a brief vacation to Colorado to visit my Dad at the family mountain home. I come back on the 7th and start the new gig on the 8th. :D&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Houston Techfest 2009</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/09/28/houston-techfest/"/>
    <updated>2009-09-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/09/28/houston-techfest</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow! That was lots of fun! I got the chance to see and talk to a lot of my friends who I haven’t seen in awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it was nice to be finally finished with my two presentations. Both were fun but I will admit to liking my Evolve Your Code material a bit more than the WPF Input Validation. They were both a lot of work. Be sure to thank presenters. I knew work went into the presentations but I didn’t appreciate how much until I tried to do two. I learned a lesson with that decision. Never do 2 new presentations. It’s way too much work and both suffer from neglect. I will write a post on all my presentation lessons later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the 2 presentations looming over me and my new job, I should be able to get back to blogging more. I love sharing what I know, even if its just to myself months from now when I forget everything. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the slides I am trying out slideshare and am also using Git Hub for the slides and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Evolve Your Code:&lt;/h4&gt;

    <title>Monads</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/08/19/monads/"/>
    <updated>2009-08-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/08/19/monads</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ryan is the monad king. Ok.. well maybe not the king. But he has a big megaphone and drops a ‘monad’ bomb daily. He has been doing some fantastic work in F# and C# using monads. He shares his code and I just stare… going WTF is this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the basic concepts of what a monad is mostly due to random discussions. I never put any solid research time into what it is… why I would use it… and where does it fit into the larger scheme of my personal development toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my adventure in learning where I normally start… wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa.. lots of new terms thrown at me. Here are some random notes and crazy thoughts I am pulling out (mostly for myself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;a monad is a kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type&quot;&gt;abstract data type&lt;/a&gt; used to represent &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation&quot;&gt;computations&lt;/a&gt; (instead of data in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model&quot;&gt;domain model&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sparks some ideas. Anyone who talks to me on a regular basis knows I am a huge Greg Young CQS fan. I think I’ve always been circling around these ideas but Greg’s insights just pulled away the haze and brought into focus the essence of what always bothered me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on Greg Young’s CQS, I would suggest &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonathan-oliver.blogspot.com/2009/03/dddd-and-cqs-getting-started.html&quot;&gt;http://jonathan-oliver.blogspot.com/2009/03/dddd-and-cqs-getting-started.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan has compiled a great set of links to get introduced to the ideas. I am by no means an expert, but I consider myself a CQS disciple. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to monads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of the ‘domain’ being a ‘computation’ or ‘action’ more than data makes me think there might be a connection to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monads allow the programmer to chain actions together to build a pipeline, in which each action is decorated with additional processing rules provided by the monad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes me think of the ‘reconstruction’ of a domain object by processing its events. That would be a neat POC to put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The return operation puts a value from a plain type into a monadic container of type M. The bind operation performs the reverse process, extracting the original value from the container and passing it to the associated next function in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still unclear on the whole wrapping business. I think I will revisit this again after going to another location to learn about monads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I moved over to Channel 9 and began to watch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Brian-Beckman-The-Zen-of-Expressing-State-The-State-Monad/&quot;&gt;http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Brian-Beckman-The-Zen-of-Expressing-State-The-State-Monad/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some random notes / quotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only two types of variables. A bound variable and a free variable. Bound variable is a function argument. A free variable has to be looked up somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State monad takes a state and spits out a state, content pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composition is good :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematics is the art of abstraction and precision&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is functional programming and monads a disruptive technology? Although it technically isn’t that ‘new’. I think it might be. The comments around an army of OO programmers and the difficulty for learning to think functionally just resonates with the idea that functional programming is a disruptive technology (even though functional programming isn’t new).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok… That was a pretty rough first day. Lots of terms and pictures and strange code thrown my way. It’s time to process the information. I’m pretty sure I will need to watch that video about 5 times in-between coding this stuff. I plan on trying Brian’s exercises along with watching ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Brian-Beckman-Dont-fear-the-Monads/&quot;&gt;Don’t Fear the Monad&lt;/a&gt;’ (another Brian Beckman presentation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan already has completed the first exercise in C# and F#. I will work on my own version of the C# exercise and then look at his code. I don’t think I will dive into F# right now. I played with the language about 2 weeks ago but all I did was create ‘Hello World’. There is a F# user group meeting on August 27th where I ‘might’ try to code these exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How do I hide columns with a Wpf GridView</title>
    <link href="http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/08/07/hide-columns-with-wpf-gridview/"/>
    <updated>2009-08-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.iamrookieone.com/blog/2009/08/07/hide-columns-with-wpf-gridview</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my current project we ran across a problem where we wanted to hide certain columns in a grid view based on domain criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked into custom grid headers, attached properties, custom controls, etc. Every path lead to a very complex and more importantly custom solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent an afternoon playing around and came up with this solution which we are using today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s simple, easy to follow, and doesn’t require any custom code. All it uses is the power of style and triggers. The biggest knock is OH NOES! you have a bit of duplication in your xaml.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you set the ‘View’ property in your style. Then you utilize style triggers to swap out the View.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup.. easy.. simple… no mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``` xml&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Style x:Key=&quot;listViewStyle&quot; TargetType=&quot;ListView&quot;&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;Setter Property=&quot;View&quot;&amp;gt; 
        &amp;lt;Setter.Value&amp;gt;

            &amp;lt;GridView&amp;gt; 
                &amp;lt;GridViewColumn Header=&quot;Name&quot; 
                                DisplayMemberBinding=&quot;{Binding Name}&quot; /&amp;gt;                        
                &amp;lt;GridViewColumn Header=&quot;Salary&quot; 
                                DisplayMemberBinding=&quot;{Binding Salary}&quot; /&amp;gt; 
            &amp;lt;/GridView&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;/Setter.Value&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;/Setter&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;Style.Triggers&amp;gt; 
        &amp;lt;DataTrigger Binding=&quot;{Binding HideCols}&quot; Value=&quot;True&quot;&amp;gt;

            &amp;lt;Setter Property=&quot;View&quot;&amp;gt; 
                &amp;lt;Setter.Value&amp;gt;

                    &amp;lt;GridView&amp;gt; 
                        &amp;lt;GridViewColumn Header=&quot;Name&quot; 
                                        DisplayMemberBinding=&quot;{Binding Name}&quot; /&amp;gt;                                
                    &amp;lt;/GridView&amp;gt;

                &amp;lt;/Setter.Value&amp;gt; 
            &amp;lt;/Setter&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;/DataTrigger&amp;gt; 
    &amp;lt;/Style.Triggers&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;/Style&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;
