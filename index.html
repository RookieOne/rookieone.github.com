  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am playing around with dynamics right now working on a solution for a completely different problem.</p>

<p>I discovered a issue I didn’t foresee (and maybe I am doing something wrong).</p>

<p>I use AssertExtensions to make my tests more readable so I created my first extension.</p>

<figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>

</div><div class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</div><div class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>I created a test to ‘get’ a property from a dynamic object.</p>

<figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>

</div><div class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>Should work right?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p><img class='' src='/images/dynamic-fail.png' width='' height='' alt=''Compile fail'' title=''Compile fail''></p>

<p>Oh noes!</p>

<p>Apparently the RuntimeBinder can’t figure out the extension to string. My solution was to do this:</p>

<figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>

<span class='line'>8</span>
<span class='line'>9</span>
<span class='line'>10</span>
<span class='line'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class='csharp'><div class='line'><span class="na">[TestMethod]</span>
</div><div class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">should_be_able_to_get_property</span><span class="p">()</span>

</div><div class='line'>

</div><div class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>I just found it interesting that it didn’t behave the way I would have expected.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The videos are up from the Adv WPF Workshop we had here at EPS.</p>

<p>Videos (the links are kind of slow and funky atm. I will look into it on Monday. I had more luck downloading the file as opposed to streaming it)</p>

<p><a href="" title="http://www.epsdownloadsite.com/downloads/7a554107-cdd0-4133-967b-913c595971ee/Advanced_WPF_JB_part1.wmv">Part 1</a>

<a href="" title="http://www.epsdownloadsite.com/downloads/8adbd281-908b-4301-8135-daddc13361f6/Advanced_WPF_JB_part3.wmv">Part 3</a>
<a href="" title="http://www.epsdownloadsite.com/downloads/8adbd281-908b-4301-8135-daddc13361f6/Advanced_WPF_JB_part4.wmv">Part 4</a>
<a href="" title="http://www.epsdownloadsite.com/downloads/8adbd281-908b-4301-8135-daddc13361f6/Advanced_WPF_JB_part5.wmv">Part 5</a></p>

<p>I had a great time talking through some of the things we are doing here with WPF. I think it took awhile to get started but towards the end I think we picked up speed.</p>

<p>I don’t exactly recall the topics right now but I believe we did cover these items from the original agenda:</p>

<ul>
<li>INotifyPropertyChange

<ul>
<li>Normal</li>
<li>Type Safe</li>
<li>Dynamic Proxy</li>
<li>AOP</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>View + ViewModel

<ul>
<li>Typical methods</li>
<li>IView extensions</li>
<li>IView<VM></li>
<li>ViewRegistry</li>
<li>Also will be covering StructureMap conventions (TypeScanners) and Type Interceptors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Event Aggregator

<ul>
<li>using Events</li>
<li>Publish extension method</li>
<li>ISubscribe</li>
<li>Putting it all together with a Region Controller</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>I guess one big note would be that PostSharp is no longer open source therefore you need a license for their 2.0 product. At EPS we picked up licenses for our current solution. The benefit we get out of PostSharp and AOP far surpasses the license price even when you have to buy the license for every developer.</p>

<p>Check PostSharp out at (http://www.sharpcrafters.com/)[http://www.sharpcrafters.com/]</p>

<p>I think we are going to work on a PostSharp CodeCast or some other informative session on the tool.</p>

<p>Considering we have the Houston Open Spaces coming up, I will probably delay another workshop for a bit. But I had a good time and will probably do another one around May or June.</p>

<p>I want to thank everyone who came online and on site. It was a lot of fun! Please provide feedback so we can make the next workshop even better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My work this iteration on my project is setting up a CI build and then migrating all our POC code to the solution.</p>

<p>Right now I am creating a simple build as practice for setting up the actual build.</p>

<p>I am approaching this from a complete n00b when it comes to creating a TFS build. I have created builds before but they have been small and just simple MSBuild files. This is the first time I am using TFS and creating not only a build but a continuous integration environment.</p>

<p>I created a Team Project and added a simple C# project to source control. I then looked at the Team Explorer and noticed that there is a Builds section under my project. Intuitively I right clicked and found where I can create a New Build Definition.</p>

<p><img class='' src='/images/tfs_thumbnail1.png' width='' height='' alt=''New Build Definition'' title=''New Build Definition''></p>

<p>I looked at the options available to me on the Build Window and noticed a Trigger section. Investigating the Trigger section allowed me to select what triggers this build. Oh look a CI trigger that builds after each check-in!</p>

<p><img class='' src='/images/tfs_thumbnail2.png' width='' height='' alt=''Continuous Integration'' title=''Continuous Integration''></p>

<p>I then had to set an output folder so I created a folder on our build machine and set the folder to that.</p>

<p><img class='' src='/images/tfs_thumbnail3.png' width='' height='' alt=''Set output folder'' title=''Set output folder''></p>

<p>And then I was done.</p>

<p>I do have to say we already had a TFS Build Controller setup so I can’t comment on that for now.</p>

<p>I then ran a couple of experiments. I first added a class foo to my project and checked in. I then double clicked on my Build under the TFS explorer and was given two reports. One report showed the current queued builds and the other had a list of the completed builds.</p>

<p>After I ran my first successful build I then made a compile error and checked it in. I then had a failed build.</p>

<p><img class='' src='/images/tfs_thumbnail4.png' width='' height='' alt=''Failed build'' title=''Failed build''></p>

<p>When I double clicked the failed build I got this UI.</p>

<p><img class='' src='/images/tfs_thumbnail5.png' width='' height='' alt=''Failed build report'' title=''Failed build report''></p>

<p>I then created a test project and then made a failing test. Now my build looks like this:</p>

<p><img class='' src='/images/tfs_thumbnail6.png' width='' height='' alt=''Build with failing tests'' title=''Build with failing tests''></p>

<p>And when I double clicked I got this report.</p>

<p><img class='' src='/images/tfs_thumbnail7.png' width='' height='' alt=''Build with failing tests report'' title=''Build with failing tests report''></p>

<p>So that was a real quick run through with creating a CI build with TFS 2010. I have to say… I was surprised that it was that easy. I am continuing my work with the build but it looks like the simple scenario was incredibly easy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I believe Jimmy Bogard has a similar technique (IHandler<T>) with ASP .Net MVC but I thought I would still share the convention I’ve been using to wire up subscriptions to the Prism Event Aggregator.</p>

<p>Whenever an object is built with StructureMap, it goes through all the TypeInterceptors. I have a SubscriptionTypeInterceptor:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In preparation for the Advanced WPF Workshop on Saturday Feb 20th, I thought I would throw together some blog posts around some techniques / code I will be sharing. JP asked the other day whether Views should have references to their ViewModels or should ViewModels have references to Views. Unfortunately twitter is a great medium for asking this question but not the best medium for answering the question.</p>

<p>I am going to try using the dry marker board as a form of communication with my blogs. I have little patience for lining up pretty lines and colored boxes with Visio or Power Point. A dry marker board is fast and allows for a free flowing expression of my ideas.</p>

<p>Let me try to diagram out how I currently manage my Views and ViewModels.</p>

<p><img class='' src='/images/view_viewmodel_viewregistry_whiteboard.jpg' width='' height='' alt=''View ViewModel ViewRegistry Whiteboard'' title=''View ViewModel ViewRegistry Whiteboard''></p>

<ol>
<li>We ask the StructureMap container for the ViewModel</li>
<li>The VM instance is intercepted by a ViewModelTypeInterceptor</li>
<li>Inside the VMTypeInterceptor

<ol>
<li>Get the V for out VM from the container</li>
<li>Get the ViewRegistry from the container</li>
<li>Register the V with the VM in the ViewRegistry</li>
<li>Return the VM</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>And finally our VM is returned being registered with a V in the ViewRegistry</li>
</ol>


<p>In short my ViewModel has no reference to my View, my View has no reference to my ViewModel (beyond setting the DataContext), and my View Registry registers the mappings between View and ViewModel.</p>

<p>The best code to look for this is in the ViewModelInterceptor:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With my current mindset that things are broken, I dive into my current readings including The Goal and The Toyota Way.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271781%3FSubscriptionId%3D0JTCV5ZMHMF7ZYTXGFR2%26tag%3Dbrdicr-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0884271781">The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement</a></p>

<p><img class='' src='/images/the-goal.jpg' width='' height='' alt='' title=''></p>

<p>I read The Goal back in my business graduate school days (about 5 years ago), but now its reading has a whole new impact. I am seeing more into the book after 5 years of working in software than I did as a fresh college graduate. Some of the mental exercises the protagonist in the book is going through I am going through as well. As he wrestles answering questions concerning his factory, I am wrestling with the questions concerning my software projects.</p>

<p>The first exercise is to define &#8216;the goal&#8217; for his company and all companies. Of course the protagonist takes a long time to come to the logical conclusion that it&#8217;s to make money.</p>

<blockquote><p>Every company&#8217;s goal is to make money.</p></blockquote>

<p>As a software consulting company, how do we make money?</p>

<blockquote><p>We make money by winning a bid for a project and then performing the work to complete the project within budget.</p></blockquote>

<p>That seems pretty simple. Nothing about data access technologies, TDD, user stories, or any sort of architecture or design pattern.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you need X done and will pay $Y then we should do X for less than $Y.</p></blockquote>

<p>Why is it so hard to deliver on that?</p>

<ol>
<li>Define X</li>
<li>Estimate Y</li>
<li>…something</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>


<p>If we scope a project then we need to know what X is. Simple to say, but man is it difficult to capture!</p>

<p>X is always in motion, a moving target. The client changes their mind, we have scope creep, and what appears simple always ends up being more complex. We all know this! Its the one constant with software development. Things are going to change.</p>

<p>From my perspective, SOLID and design patterns focus on writing code that is more adaptive to change.</p>

<blockquote><p>SOLID and design patterns in of themselves do NOT move us towards our goal by reducing the cost of writing software.</p>

<p>SOLID and design patterns move us towards our goal when our software has to change because the cost of the change has been reduced.</p></blockquote>

<p>The principles and patterns also provide a common language for developers. That common language moves us closer to the goal because current and new developers can grok more of the design in less time. And time = money.</p>

<p>Where does testing fit into all this?</p>

<p>Testing allows us to keep track of the quality of our production. Or.. does it? After some re-examination I want to say testing adds no quality. That will have to be another post.</p>

<p>Testing provides a way to measure our progress towards X. We know we are moving towards X because we can have tests that verify we are delivering towards our promise. When I mention testing I am using a broad definition and including all sorts of tests from UAT testers to automated unit tests.</p>

<p>So what does Test Driven Development (TDD) provide? TDD focuses every bit of code towards satisfying a test. If every test is relevant towards progress towards X, then TDD focuses our development towards productive work. Logically any work not moving us towards delivering X to our clients is unproductive work.</p>

<p>What conclusions have I come to?</p>

<p>The goal of a software consulting company is to make money. We make money by completing X under $Y. One of the important steps is to then define what X is. We know X will change so we should write code that is adaptive to change, but we need to balance that with only writing code that moves us towards delivering X.</p>

<ul>
<li>We achieve more flexible and understandable code by using SOLID and design patterns.</li>
<li>We measure our progress towards X by passing tests.</li>
<li>TDD focuses our coding towards productive work.</li>
</ul>


<p>I started to write about estimation in this section but have decided to move it to another post.</p>

<p>After thinking about estimation, it has nothing to do with knowing what X is. Estimation has to do with what we think $Y is. X is what X is regardless if it takes you 3 hours or 3 months to deliver.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love talking with Ryan and others passionate about new technology and languages. Lately though I have been increasingly jaded with anything ‘new’.</p>

<p>How many different data technologies do we need? ADO .Net, Nhibernate, Linq-2-SQL, Entity Framework version.. whatever. We have been connecting to databases for over 20 years so why are we still worrying about this?!</p>

<p>The sheer number of UI frameworks is reaching the point of ridiculousness. I was reading the WPF Disciples Google Group and ran across this post. Paul Stovell listed all the MVVM, MVC, MVC frameworks he knew of (around 11). Then everyone was commenting with their own ‘me too’ response.</p>

<p>Am I the only one who finds that utterly hilarious? How many frameworks do we need?!</p>

<p>Ryan is extremely involved with Ruby, Python, F#, and the other ‘new’ languages to the .Net Framework. I have been delaying learning Ruby for too long, because it&#8217;s hard to get motivated to learn a new language. I see the potential and the possibilities, but I quickly get discouraged and uninterested.</p>

<p>I have to ask myself… why am I jaded? Why am I disinterested in things that used to excite me?</p>

<p>The more I thought about it, the more the conclusion became crystal clear. Every project I have been a part of has had the same problems. None of the problems were technology related.</p>

<p>Why would I get excited about a solution to a problem I don’t have?</p>

<p>Reminds me of Karl Pilkington’s comment about this picture of twins on one of the Ricky Gervais podcasts. Karl saw a picture of a set of twins on an office desk (obviously the kids of the guy sitting at the desk). His great idea was since they look alike and are dressed alike, the parent could just have the picture of one of them and save space. Ricky Gervais then commented something like :</p>

<p>What you have there is the best non-solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>And that is pretty much how I feel about most of the technological innovations these days.</p>

<p>For example: can someone explain to me how Oslo is going to help me? I am also not sold on RIA or anything Cloud related. The technology is interesting, but I can’t justify where I would use any of this stuff.</p>

<p><img class='left ' src='/images/shoveling-coal.jpg' width='240' height='165' alt=''Shoveling Coal'' title=''Shoveling Coal''></p>

<p>Sometimes I feel like a lone engineer shoveling coal into a furnace on a runaway train. I don&#8217;t know where we are going, where we have been, and all I hear is FASTER, FASTER!</p>

<p>When I scream for help, I get delivered a better shovel.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want a better shovel, I want to know why I am shoveling so much coal!!!</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t we do more with less? Can’t we slow down? Do we even know why we are in this train?!</p>

<p>Lately the murmurings on different blogs, podcasts, and developers has been that software development has gotten too complicated. How can that be true when we have tons of tools and frameworks that should make life easier? jQuery makes Javascript easier. Pick your favorite Data Access tool / ORM makes data access easier. Any number of UI frameworks makes UI construction easier. So why do we think things are more complicated? Shouldn’t our life be easier?</p>

<p>The majority of projects are always behind, always over budgeted, and always unclear on where they are and where they are going. This has been my experience spanning multiple companies and multiple positions on different teams. I am fully humble enough to recognize that “I” might be the problem, but I doubt it. There is enough shared pain through my conversations with other developers to recognize its a industry wide problem.</p>

<p>The only project I was a part of that didn’t feel this way had a full time Project Manager and a team full of very skilled developers. To me it didn’t feel like the project was better run, it was just we had enough skilled team members to overcome any poor execution or poor planning. That isn’t saying our PM wasn’t an all star because he was. My point is that although the project was a ‘success’ I didn’t feel like it was successful because we had a great methodology. We just powered through any complications.</p>

<p>Every project (including that last ‘successful’ one) always had mad dashes of insane hours of work followed by listless lulls as we waited for one thing or another. I never felt I had enough time to do my work and other activities related to work (ie blog, present, create frameworks)</p>

<p>Where am I going with this? I wanted to capture my state of mind and why I am re-examining how and why I develop.</p>

<p>The status quo will burn me out.</p>

<p>The ole definition of insanity : Doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.</p>

<p>I am tired of doing the same thing, so what can I do different? Why is there this constant pain? I know there are solutions and it&#8217;s time for me to document my mental journey as I search for answers. Maybe my breadcrumbs will help those that follow.</p>
